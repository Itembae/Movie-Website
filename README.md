HindSight Documentation

HindSight is a movie-reviewing web-based application programmed primarily in Python. To run it, download the file submitted, open it in VS Code (or your equivalent of it), change into the final directory and execute “flask run.” Clicking the generated link will redirect you to the login page of HindSite.

If registered, use your credentials to login. Otherwise, clicking the Register button in the top right corner will redirect you to the registration page, where you must provide your name, date of birth and email address, as well as choosing and confirming your password. Upon confirmation, you should once again be redirected to the login page. Input your login credentials, click login, and you will be taken to the Home page.

On the Home Page, the user will see “Fresh Reviews,” a list of the 30 most recently reviewed movies and their ratings. Clicking on any title will open them all up so that the accompanying comments can be read. At the top of the Home page is a navigation bar with buttons linked to the main pages of the website: Review, Watch, Search, Profile and Log Out. Clicking any of the navbar buttons will automatically take you to its page. The “Review” page displays a form that allows users to post a movie review by typing in its name, providing a rating out of 10, leaving a comment and clicking Post. The “Watch” page allows users to get movie recommendations by having them search for an actor, director or year, and scanning our extensive movie database to display the 5 most highly rated movies matching their search criteria. “Search” allows the user to input and submit a movie title, and search through our entire database to see all reviews posted about that movie. It also displays some information about the movie from the general (non-Hindsight user) populace.
“Profile” displays all of the user's stored information. Here they can see and edit their personal information, and view a record of all reviews they have ever posted. Clicking “Log Out,” in the top right corner will  sign the user out and clear their session, returning them to the login screen. Using the varied features of Hindsight, users can find their next watch in no time.
